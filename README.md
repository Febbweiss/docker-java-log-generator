Goal :

This is a simple Docker container to provide random java logs. It's based on [log-generator](https://github.com/Febbweiss/log-generator)

The default behaviour is the following :

java -jar /log-generator-0.0.2.jar -n 15 -r 1000
The endless generated file is located in /var/log/java/app.log.
